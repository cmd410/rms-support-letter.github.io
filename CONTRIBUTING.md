## Adding translations

To translate the letter, copy `index.md` into `_translation/`
and name it `index_lang.md` where `lang` is language code you are going to translate into.

Then you can start translating this file.

To display translation in the translations list, simply add `emoji` attribute to the document as follows:

For example: `_translations/index_de.md`

```md
---
layout: signed
...
emoji: ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
---
